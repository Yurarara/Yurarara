Hi, Raymond here.

This repository is for my personal study/project. I store my notes and codes from my study here for future reference. They mostly consist of the Java scripts, from the basics to 
the use of frameworks including Spring/Springboot/Spring MVC/etc. It will also be (hopefully) the largest proportion, b/c I learned as my first programming language.

There will also be the R language. This includes some of my practices of R programming, including data visualization, GLM & GAM analysis, and some basic machine learning. The 
scripts and notes are based on the book Advanced R Statistical Programming and Data Models by Matt Wiley and Joshua F Wiley. I do my best to keep them coherent and comprehensive,
although not all contents in the book can be included - that will be just a copy of the book.
They are more of the result from my study rather than the notes, because I write them for familirizing myself with R. However, I also record my thoughts in the scripts.

The rest will be some python scripts serving as algorithm realizations, because I believe it's an easier language for algorthms than Java or C#. They are based on the book Essential 
Algorithms: A Practical Approach to Computer Algorithms Using Python and C#, 2nd Edition, by Rod Stephens. Compared to my R notes, they will be more scattered as I omit more from
the book's content as I write the codes.
